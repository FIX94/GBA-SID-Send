# GBA-SID-Send
A gc and wii homebrew to send .sid files to a gba using the gba link cable.  
# Usage
All you need is a folder called "sid" on your main device (sd gecko on gamecube and sd/usb on wii) and put in some .sid (PSID) files.  
If you then start GBA-SID-Send you can just select the file you want and transfer it to your gba in port 2 by pressing A.  
This project uses sid-the-kid by Mic (forked by me to use MultiBoot) as the SID Player.
